       <div><p class="first">Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, the answer is always the same: <br><br>

a phrase,<br>
 a line, <br>
a scrap <br>
of language, <br>
a rhythm,<br>
 an image,<br>
 something seen, <br>
heard, <br>
witnessed,<br>
 or imagined. <br><br>

And the lesson is always the same, <br><br>

and young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: </p></div> 
        
        
        
        <div><p class="second">if you have any idea for a poem, 

an exact grid of intent</p></div>
        
        
        
        
        
        <div><p class="third">the wrong path, 

a dead-end alley, 

at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed. 


This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error. </p></div>
