    <div><p class="first">but there is no book i know of on the subject of how poems begin.<br><br>


how can the origin be traced<br><br>


when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace?<br><br>


 it is exactly like tracing the moment of the big bang—<br><br>

we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning, before the universe burst into being,<br>

but we can’t go back to the precise beginning<br><br>

because that would precede knowledge, <br>


and we can’t “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born. </p></div>
