something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone is tired of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo for snow. <br><br>

This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: <br><br>

Some languages are so constructed—<br><br>

English among them—<br><br><br>




           <strong><em>that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime.</em> <br><br><br></strong>




That sentence begins with your first words, toddling around the kitchen, and ends with your last words right before you step into the limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. <br><br>

Or, <br>
if you are blessed,<br><br>



they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end. </p></div>
