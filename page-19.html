       <div><p class="first">gaston bachelard says the single most succinct and astonishing thing: <br>
—We begin in admiration and we end by <br>
—organizing our <br>
—disappointment. <br><br><br>


the moment of admiration is the experience of something unfiltered, vital and fresh—it could also be horror—and the moment of organization is both the 
—onset of disappointment<br>
—and its dignification; the least we can do is <br>
—dignify our knowingness, <br>
—the loss of some vitality through familiarization, <br>
—by admiring not the thing itself but how we can —organize it, <br>
  —think about it.<br>
